        Conway's Game of Life, The Musical!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the musical version of Conway's game of life! Click on a square to turn it off or on, and press space to start playing! The output will display like a sequencer, a bar moving left to right, 
        playing a tone for each filled cell and ignoring empty cells. The note played is determined by the location of the square on the grid. By default, moving horizontally causes a change by a major third and
        moving vertically causes a change by a perfect fifth. These intervals, the total pitch range (after which it will reset to middle A), whether the sides are looped, the update speed, the volume, and the
        oscillator type can all be updated from the tweakpane menu. If you want to understand how the sonification works, increase the update speed slider until you can process what's happening one note at a
        time. <b><i><u>Press space to play or pause!</u></i></b>
