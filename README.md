## Frequency of Delayed and Cancelled Flights

I used a delayed flights dataset from awesome json datasets. I believed it would be interesting to explore trends, if any, amongst different airports across the US throughout recent years. The goal of the application is to see the change over time in flight delays and cancellations across 6 major US airports. For user interaction I added an info button that the user can click on, a toggle button that changes between the cancelled flights and delayed flights charts, a slider that changes the year of the data being viewed, and a drop down menu that allows the user to select an airport. Some challenges I faced were some of the years for some airports not having a complete set of data for all the months, so I had to cherry pick which airports and the range of time I did it for.
