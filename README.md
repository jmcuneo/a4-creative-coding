## Music Visualization

Hosted site: https://a4-joelhokkanen.glitch.me

This appplication makes a visualization of an audio file as it plays but showing the frequency spread. Frequencies are mapped onto a circle on the canvas that spikes where frequencies are stronger. The circle corresponds to the lowest frequencies at the 9:00 position and higher frequencies going clockwise. The Tweakpane controls allow the user to change aspects of the visualization, such as their color or size, as well as the audio, with gain and panning controls. The biggest challenges of this project were figuring out how to display the frequency data in a visually appealing way and implementing Tweakpane into the project.
