## Luke Foley's Game of Life!

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- The goal of this application is to create a highly-customizeable implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. In this game, you can edit the size of the canvas, the color or the selected boxes, and the tick speed of the game. The preset options are saved in and retrieved from the Express server.
- The biggest challenge in creating this game was creating the logic for the game. I thought that creating the iterations for the game would be hard, though this is handled quite easily through the setInterval() function in JavaScript. It was also a challenge to figure out how to count the numebr of neighbors when the block was at the edge of the board.
- the instructions in the website modal should make the rules of the game clear, and how to use the game is pretty self explanatory.
