## 2D Audio Visualizer

https://a4-aidanmacnevin.glitch.me/

I created a 2D Audio Visualizer using the WebAudio API and Canvas tag. It runs via an express server. The visualizer's default song is "All The Things She Said" by Simple Minds.

Users are able to change the color of the canvas, visualizer bars, the height of the bars, the quantity of the bars, and upload their own audio file. There;s also an easter egg! (230 185 111 204 33 60)

On loading the page, a popup explains the details of the user interface and how to use the application. 

I really enjoyed messing around with the different parts of audio visualization and using the draw() method. One of the challenges I faced during this development was trying to adjust the user interface to have a layout I wanted. Additionally, I had some challenges dealing with starting and stopping the audio. The final challenge was making sure that all the elements that needed to update would update on certain events, such as changing the colors, toggling views, and more.
