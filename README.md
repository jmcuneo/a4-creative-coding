Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application is to visualize 3D audio using ball and planar meshes.
- There was a learning curve for understanding Three.js and Web Audio
- I have not taken Computer Graphics
- I have incorporated an instructions html page in the beginning
- the instructions you present in the website should be clear enough to use the application, but if you feel any need to provide additional instructions please do so here.
- I also found adding tweakpane to be a little challenging
- Using tweakpane you can change the volume of the audio, add the title, artist name, and genre
