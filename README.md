- This node.js website uses Express and D3 to create a bargraph of the US GDP over time. 
- **Here is the link to the dataset** https://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/USA/indicators/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?per_page=5000&format=json
- I implemented express like we went over in class 
- I used the D3 and SVG tech guide and this YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDpBAFvdjYo
- I looked at other data visulizations options like a scatter plot, but a bar graph worked with this dataset
- Tried to adjust the year visable but descided to change color of the bar graph.
- added Aria Accessabilty to the HTML 
- I orginally did the compontents assignment but I could not get React to work on glicth with my assingment 2
