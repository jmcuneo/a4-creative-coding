## Haddaway - What is Love audiovisualization

http://a4-nicholaswhalen.glitch.me


My goal was to create a basic audio visualization for a song. I have experience working with audio and the frequency spectrum, so I thought this would be a good fit for my project. I used THREE.js to create my visualization. The main challenges I faced were learning how to use THREE.js, as I have no previous experience with it, however, I had a good idea of what I needed to actually do to accomplish my goal because of my past experience. 

To use the application, simply click the play button at the top of the page. The color of each cube can also be changed. I used this as my four inputs required for the project. They will change in real time.
