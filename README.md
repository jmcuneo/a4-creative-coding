## Boid Simulation

https://a4-jaysoncaissie.glitch.me/

This program is a visual program that simulates flocking/schooling behavior of animals such as birds or fish. 
The goal of completing this project was to learn how to use three.js, as well as learn how to program simple behavior to "characters" in a scene
I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to make the scene look right. 
Converting the world coordinates to screen cordinates so that the mouse worked with the scene correctly took most of my time

Parameters are located in the bottom-right of the application
